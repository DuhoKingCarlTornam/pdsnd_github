### Project Title
Explore Bikeshare Data - R

### Description
Overview
In this project, you will make use of R to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics and making visualizations!

What Software Do I Need?
You can perform all operations directly within the classroom. However, if you would like to work on your local machine, you will need to install R.

What Does A Submission Look Like?
There are two possible ways to submit your work. You may submit your work using the classroom notebook, which you will find in the Project Workspace part of this lesson. The details of what should be in your notebook are shared on the next pages of this lesson.

We recommend that you submit via the classroom workspace on the previous page. However, you can also submit your work by uploading your notebook or a link to a Github repository using this page.

Before submitting, check your solution against the Rubric.
